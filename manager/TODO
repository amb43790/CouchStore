Switch to using sammy.nested_params for parsing all the scan-*-quan, scan-*-name, etc
params from orders

Eliminate warehouse-id from the order docs and just store warehouse-name instead

Make tests!

Refactor the shipment-order-picker to use objects instead of already formatted strings

Make a check-box on the 'make a sale' page that would immediately mark the items as shipped

'is-taxable' on orders needs to be true or false, not 1, 0, "", etc
'shipping-charge' needs to be an integer number of cents

daily sale summary report:
order-source    order-number    sku     quantity    price-each  shipping-charge   shipping-cost  warehouse  is-taxable
one line for each different sku
final line giving the total charged to the customer
don't show shipping-charge for 2nd and later shipments

incorrectly put two line-items in the order table
